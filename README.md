#As a second year student in communication networks and security,  it was my first experience with web security through practical exploration. As a first-time user of Yield Cat, some things did not feel intuitive, and I have several suggestions to make the web application more student-friendly.

Here are the suggestions:
Multiple sections for students accessing the site at different levels of knowledge and experience
Navigation tabs with key information, links and downloadable content for each individual component/vulnerability
Groundwork for methodical testing at beginner level

On a whole, while the experience was challenging it was also fun learning and playing around with the site. I have since gained new knowledge and would definitely be open to learning more about web security.
